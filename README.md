This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was made to support fantasy sports draft lotteries. It is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://mwilkens31.github.io/draftLottery).<br>

Currently 8-14 team leagues are supported. Potential future improvements include support for wider team counts, and more default lottery settings.
Currently the default setting is to use the NBA draft lottery which was used from 2005-2018. Potential future settings could include the current NBA draft settings, and reverse standings order.
